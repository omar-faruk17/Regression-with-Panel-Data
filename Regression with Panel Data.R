# Fatalities dataset is a panel data the demonstrate annual state level observations on US traffic fatalities for the period 1982 through 1988.
# For panel data regression, we have to use plm library.

# In contrast to cross-section data where we have observations on n subjects (entities), panel data has observation on n entites at T >= 2 time periods.

# Load Fatalities dataset.
data(Fatalities)
fatal <- Fatalities # Created a copy of the Fatalities dataset named 'fatal' for easier handling 

# Obtain the dimension and inspect the structure 
is.data.frame(fatal)
dim(fatal)
str(fatal)

# list of first few observations
head(fatal)

# summarize the variables 'state' and 'year'
summary(fatal$state)
summary(fatal$year)
summary(fatal [,c(1,2)]) # alternative code

# We found that the dataset consists of 34 variable and 336 observations. this dataset containing 48 states and has 7 levels of identifying the time period when the observaion was made. This gives us 7*8 = 336 observations in total.
# Since all variables are observed for all entites and over all time periods, the panel is balaced. If there were missing data for at least one entity in at least one time period we would call the panel is unbalanced.

# Fixed effects regression
# .............................................................................

# Application to traffic deaths
# ...........................................................
# The simple fixed effects model for estimation of the relation between traffic fatality rates and the beer taxes is 
m_fatal_fe <- lm(fatal_rate ~ beertax + state - 1, data = fatal) # -1 for removing the intercept term in the model. The model will estimate separate coefficients for each state, without a reference category (i.e., no baseline). 
summary(m_fatal_fe)
# So it is possible to estimate B1 by applying OLS to the demeaned data, that is, to run the regression (FatalityRate = B1BeerTaxit + Uit)

# Obtained demeaned data
fatal_demeaned <- with(fatal, data.frame(fatal_rate = fatal_rate - ave(fatal_rate, state),
                                         beertax = beertax - ave(beertax, state)))
# The function ave is convenient for computing group averages. We use it to obtain states specific average of the fatal rate and the beer tax.
# estimate the regression
summary(lm(fatal_rate ~ beertax -1, data = fatal_demeaned))

# Alternative one may use from the package with the same name.
# Since the fixed effects estimator is also called the within estimator =, we set model = "within"

# estimate the fixed effects regression with plm()
fatal_fe_model <- plm(fatal_rate ~ beertax,
                      data = fatal,
                      index = c ("state", "year"),
                      model = "within")
# print summary using robust standard errors
coeftest(fatal_fe_model, vcov = vcovHC, type = "HC1")
# The estimated coefficient is again - 0.66. Note that plm() uses the entity demeaned OLS algorithm and thus does not report dummy coefficients.
# The estimated regression function is: FatalRate = -0.66 * Beertax + StateFixedEffects.
# The coefficient on BeerTax is negative and significant, suggesting that a $1 increase in the real beer tax reduces traffic fatalities by 0.66 per 10,000 people. 
# While state fixed effects control for biases from factors that differ between states but not over time, there may still be time-varying omitted variables causing bias.




#.....................................................................................
# Regression with time Fixed effects 
# .............................................................................
# To estimate the combined entity and time fixed effects model of the relation between fatalities and beer tax: 
#. FatalityRate_it = B1 Beertax_it + StateEffects + TimeFixedEffects + U_it

# By using both lm() and plm() we can estimate the above equation.
# .............................................

# via lm()
fatal_te_fe_lm <- lm(fatal_rate ~beertax +state + year - 1, data = fatal)
fatal_te_fe_lm

# via plm()
fatal_te_fe_plm <- plm(fatal_rate ~beertax,
                       data = fatal,
                       index = c ("state", "year"),
                       model = "within",
                       effect = "twoways")
coeftest(fatal_te_fe_plm, vcov = vcovHC, type = "HC1")

# Before discussing the outcomes we convince ourselves that state and year are of the class factor.
# check the calss of 'state' and 'year'
class(fatal$state)
class(fatal$year)

# The lm() function automatically turns categorical variables (factors) into dummy variables. Since we remove the intercept by adding -1 to the regression formula, 
# the lm() function estimates coefficients for a total of 54 dummy variables [n+T-1] (48 for states and 6 for years). However, the plm() function only displays the estimated coefficient for BeerTax.

# The estimated regression function is: Fatality Rate = -0.64 Ã— BeerTax + State Effects + TimeFixedEffects
# The result of -0.66 is similar to the estimated coefficient from the regression model that includes only entity fixed effects. 
# As expected, the estimate is less precise but still significantly different from zero at the 10% level. This suggests that the relationship between traffic fatalities and the real beer tax is not influenced by omitted variable bias from factors that remain constant over time.




#.....................................................................................
# The Fixed effects Regression assumptions and standard errors for fixed effects regression
# .............................................................................

# Assumptions
#..............
# 1. The first assumption is that the error is uncorrelated with all observations of the variable X for the entity i over time. If this assumption is violated, we face omitted variables bias.
# 2. The Xit are allowed to be autocorrelated within entities. This is a common proporty of time series data. the same is allowed for errors Uit.
# 3. Large outliers are unlikely have nonzero finite fourth moments. Ols is sensitive to outliers, so we need to exclude them before estimating a model.
# 4. There is no perfect multicollinerity.


# Standard errors for fixed effects regression
#...............................................
# Standard errors in fixed effects models which differ from standard errors in multiple regression as the regression error can exhibit serial correlation in panel models.
# Similar as for Heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation invalidates the useal standard error formulas as well as heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors since these are derived under the assumption that there is no autocorrelation.
# To account for both heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation, "heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent" (HAC) standard errors are needed. Clustered standard errors belong to these type of standard errors. 
# They allow for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelated errors within an entity but not correlation across entities. covHC() in coeftest() function recognizes panel model objects (objects of class plm) and computes clustered standard errors by default.



#...................................................
# Drunk driving Laws and Traffic Deaths
#.....................................................
#In the previous model we did not incorporate the variables like economic conditions and driving laws to predict the relationship between traffic fatalities and beer taxes.
# The covariates we can use from the dataset are:
str(fatal[, c("unemp", "income", "drinkage", "jail", "service", "miles")])

# categorizes the minimum legal drinking age into categories (bins)
fatal$drinkage_category <- cut(fatal$drinkage,  # The variable to be categorized
                               breaks = 18:22,  # Define breakpoints for age groups (18 to 22)
                               include.lowest = TRUE,  # Ensure 18 is included in the first bin
                               right = FALSE)  # Create left-closed, right-open intervals [a, b)

# Example of how the categorization works:
# If drinkage = 18   â†’ Assigned to category [18,19)
# If drinkage = 18.8 â†’ Assigned to category [18,19) (because 18 â‰¤ 18.8 < 19)
# If drinkage = 19   â†’ Assigned to category [19,20)
# If drinkage = 20   â†’ Assigned to category [20,21)
# If drinkage = 21   â†’ Assigned to category [21,22)

# setting the (21,22) as the refrence or baseline level
fatal$drinkage_category <- relevel(fatal$drinkage_category, "[21,22]")

# Create a new categorical variable 'punish' in the 'fatal' dataset
fatal$punish <- with(fatal, factor(jail == "yes" | service == "yes",  # Check if either 'jail' or 'service' is "yes"
                            labels = c("no", "yes")))  # Label FALSE as "no" and TRUE as "yes"

# Model specifications (4) to (7) include covariates capturing state economic conditions and legal frameworks. Taking (4) as the baseline, we find:

# Test if legal drinking age has no explanatory power

# 3. There is no strong evidence that punishing first-time offenders reduces drunk driving, as the corresponding coefficient is not statistically significant at the 10% level.
# 4. Economic factors play a significant role in explaining traffic fatalities. Both the employment rate and per capita income are jointly significant at the 0.1% level.
# Test if economic indicators (income and unemployment) have no explanatory power

# Model (5) suggests that economic factors play an important role, as removing them alters the beer tax coefficient. 
# Model (6) indicates that the legal drinking age has little explanatory power, and changes in how it is modeled do not significantly affect the results. 
# Model (7) shows that using a smaller sample increases standard errors but does not drastically change the coefficient estimates.

# Conclusion
#.............
# Our findings suggest that stricter punishments and higher drinking ages do not significantly reduce traffic fatalities, while alcohol taxes may have a negative but imprecise effect. 
# If standard panel regression methods prove insufficient, instrumental variables regression can help address potential omitted variable bias.
