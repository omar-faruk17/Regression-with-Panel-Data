# Panel Data Regression Analysis with R

## Overview

This repository contains R code and analysis derived from the chapter 10: **Regression with Panel Data** in the book **"Introduction to Econometrics with R"** by Christoph Hank, Martin Arnold, Alexander Gerber, and Martin Schmelzer. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the application of panel data regression techniques using R, providing a comprehensive resource for those seeking to understand and apply these methods in their own work.

The analysis covers the following key steps:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Estimating regression models on panel data
- Interpreting results, including diagnostic tests
- Presenting results in a clear and structured format using R Markdown

### Key Features:
- **R Scripts:** R code for data manipulation, regression analysis, and model interpretation, complete with explanatory comments.
- **R Markdown:** A detailed narrative that accompanies the R scripts, providing step-by-step explanations of the code, analysis process, and results. This file is designed to support a deeper understanding of the techniques and their applications.

This repository serves as an instructional resource for learning panel data regression methods in R, while also providing practical examples for users to replicate and adapt to their own datasets.
